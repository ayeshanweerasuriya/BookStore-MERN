# npm init -y

The -y flag in the npm init -y command is a shortcut for automatically accepting default values when initializing a new Node.js project with npm. It saves you from having to manually confirm each setting during the initialization process.

Without the -y flag, when you run npm init, npm will prompt you to enter information such as the package name, version, description, entry point, test command, repository URL, author, license, and more. You would need to respond to each prompt with a value or press Enter to accept the default value for each field.

# npm i express nodemon

Express: Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, handling HTTP requests and responses, and more. When you install Express using npm i express, it downloads and installs the Express package and its dependencies, making it available for use in your Node.js projects.

Nodemon: Nodemon is a utility that helps in development by automatically restarting your Node.js application when changes are detected in your source code. This saves you from manually stopping and restarting the server every time you make changes to your code. Installing Nodemon with npm i nodemon makes it possible to use Nodemon as a development dependency in your project.
